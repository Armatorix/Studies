How it works ?
./program.sh d AES CBC keystore.ks no1 crypted_sample decryped_sample

Decrypts crypred_sample into decrypted_sample with aes-256-cbc with password from keystore.ks with alias no1, password for keystore.ks is "password".

./program.sh e AES CBC keystore.ks no1 decryped_sample crypted_sample 
As before but encrypts decrypted into crypted. 

Program will show if password used for decrypting is wrong.
